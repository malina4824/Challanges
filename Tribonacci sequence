#The "Tribonacci sequence" challenge is a twist on the famous Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the preceding three numbers.
#For example, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7 â€¦
#The challenge: Write a function that returns the nth number in the Tribonacci sequence.

def sir(n):
    if n == 0:
        return n
    elif n == 1 or n == 2:
        return(1)
    else:
        return (sir(n-1)+sir (n-2) + sir(n-3))
